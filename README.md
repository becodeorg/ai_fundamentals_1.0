Repo for the first AI fundamentals pilot.

In this repo you will find all the course material or additional resources.


## Course structure

The material is divided into 3 main categories:

### Bonus_resources
In [Bonus_resources](./Bonus_resources) you will find all the additional materials that are not part of the course's scope but was requested by the learners.

You will find some interesting courses about:
- [deployement](./Bonus_resources/deployment) how to deploy your code to make it accessible by the outside world.
    - [Flask](./Bonus_resources/deployment/1.Flask) how to make an API in python
    - [Docker](./Bonus_resources/deployment/2.Docker) how to containerise your code to make it deployment ready.
    - [Web services](./Bonus_resources/deployment/4.Web_Application) where and how  to deploy your code in the cloud for free.
    - [Deploy jupyter](./Bonus_resources/deployment/5.deploy_jupyter) How  to deploy your jupyter  notebook in the could.
- [Git](./Bonus_resources/Git) How to version your code with Git and Github

### Content
