Repo for the first AI fundamentals pilot.

In this repo you will find all the course material or additional resources.


## Course structure

The material is divided into 3 main categories:

### Bonus_resources
In [bonus_resources](./bonus_resources) you will find all the additional materials that are not part of the course's scope but was requested by the learners.

You will find some interesting courses about:
- [deployement](./bonus_resources/deployment) how to deploy your code to make it accessible by the outside world.
    - [Flask](./bonus_resources/deployment/1.Flask) how to make an API in python
    - [Docker](./bonus_resources/deployment/2.Docker) how to containerise your code to make it deployment ready.
    - [Web services](./bonus_resources/deployment/4.Web_Application) where and how  to deploy your code in the cloud for free.
    - [Deploy jupyter](./bonus_resources/deployment/4.deploy_jupyter) How  to deploy your jupyter  notebook in the could.
- [Git](./bonus_resources/Git) How to version your code with Git and Github
- [Tools](./bonus_resources/Tools) What is a pre-commit hook and how to ensure code quality in the team.

### Content
in [content](./content) your will find the main course about AI.

You will find some interesting courses about:

    - [Python basic](./content/1.python/python_basics)
    - [Python advanced](./content/1.python/python_advanced)
- [Basic preprocessing](./content/2.basic_preprocessing) How to preprocess your data to make it usable.
- [Deep learning](./content/3.deep_learning_into) You will learn what is deep learning and  the basics concepts.
- [First neuronal network](./content/4.First_neuronal_network) Let's build of first neuronal network!
- [TFIDF](./content/5.TFIDF) Our first document classification problem, let's solve it!
- [Advance preprocessing](./content/6.advanced_preprocessing) Now that we can use deep learning let's see advanced preprocessing concepts.
- [Advanced modeling](./content/7.advanced_modeling) Do you want to dive deeper into deep learning? Let's see advanced models!

### Tech talks
in [Tech talks](./Tech_talks) you will find all the presentations and talks we had during the training.

This program couldn't be  possible  without the help of the [ESF](https://www.esf-vlaanderen.be/nl).
