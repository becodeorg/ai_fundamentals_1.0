    "In most object-oriented languages, objects are manipulated by references. This means that when you create an object, an ID is assigned to it. This ID is not the object itself but refers to the location of the object in the memory.This is the case, for example, of Java, class objects of C # and Swift (unlike objects of type struct), Python, JavaScript and Ruby. In this case, the fact that the state of an object shared by reference may or may not be modified is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an object is considered immutable, a copy can be obtained by simply duplicating its reference, instead of copying the entire object. Since a reference (which usually stores only the size of a pointer) is usually much smaller than the object itself, this technique both saves memory and improves the speed of execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reference copying technique is much more complex to use for variable objects, because if any element using the reference to a variable object modifies it, the modification will become visible to all other elements using the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technique of always using references instead of copies of identical immutable objects, storing their value only once in memory, is called \"interning\". In this context, two objects are considered equal if and only if their references, typically represented by integers, are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python language, the types bool, tuple, str, bytes, frozenset, range are immutable, as well as the numerical types int, float and complex. The list is not exhaustive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple objects are immutable lists of heterogeneous objects in Python. We can see the tuple type as the immutable counterpart of the list, and frozenset as the immutable counterpart of the set. Contrary to what we observe for example in Ruby language, strings (str) are immutable. Bit strings (bytes) also, but there is a variable bytearray type. \n",
