    "### Black\n",
    "\n",
    "[black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) is a formatter for Python. It will format all your code following the PEP8 standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MyPy\n",

It will avoid you to run tests that take a while to run, to discover that during the last test, you forgot an import in a file. Or simply improve you code's speed because you're sure that you import no modules that you don't use. The code formatting will also improve the readability of your code a lot and that's something that you can totally forget when focusing on the most import thing: fixing your business problem. Indeed, sometimes you can overlook that you forgot to type all the functions or add a space after a parenthesis. "
