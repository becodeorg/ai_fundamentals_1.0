    "# Good practices\n",
    "\n",
    "In python as in other languages, there are conventions on how to write code. You don't have to respect all of them, but some of them have become unanimously used. Let's see together a summary of the most important rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## PEP8 in summary !\n",
    "\n",
    "PEP 8 (for Python Extension Proposal) is a set of rules that allows to homogenize the code and to apply good practices. The best known example is the war between developers over whether to indent code with spaces or tabs. The PEP 8 is the winner: it is the spaces that win, 4 in number. End of the debate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very interesting logic for Python, which aims to be a language \"that can be read\" rather than \"a language that can be written\". So yes, this sentence doesn't mean anything but writing code understandable for a machine is rather easy, but writing code understandable by the greatest number of coders (of any level) is a different story...\n",
    "\n",
    "PEP 8 provides rules and conventions to make the coder's reading easier and thus make him less stressed and more productive. The advantage of PEP 8 is that it makes the code more attractive. So I still don't know if the code is embellished with PEP 8 or if the fact of introducing rules doesn't make the code without PEP 8 ugly. You can tell from reading a script that the author hasn't followed these basic rules and therefore is not a good coder. This is not necessarily the case but...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indentation\n",
    "The indentation in your code must be 4 characters. The more is too much, the less is not enough. On the coffeescript side for example it's 2, it's ugly. Shame on them. It had to be written somewhere, it's done."

You can add some in a function too (if you can't do otherwise or for exceptional reasons) but after the docstring. Allow one line per import. Separate imports.
