And, if your program contains multi-level inheritance, then this `super()` function is helpful for you.\n",

In theory, a well designed API should make it always possible but we know that boundary cases exist: the original method may have side effects that you want to avoid and sometimes the API cannot be refactored to avoid them. In those cases you may prefer to skip the call to the original implementation of the method; Python does not make it mandatory, so feel free to walk that path if you think the situation requires it. Be sure to know what you are doing, however, and document why you are completely overwriting the method."
