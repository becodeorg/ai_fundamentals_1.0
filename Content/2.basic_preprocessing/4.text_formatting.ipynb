Lorem Ipsum has been  the industry's standard dummy text ever since the  1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley  of type and scrambled it to  make a type specimen  book. It has survived  not only five centuries, but  also the leap  into electronic typesetting ,  remaining essentially unchanged . It was popularised  in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop  publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. \"\n",
