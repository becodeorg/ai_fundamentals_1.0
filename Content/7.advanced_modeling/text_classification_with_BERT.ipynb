    "# Text classification with BERT\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from **Transformers**) is a NLP model developed by Google in 2018. It is a model that is already pre-trained on a 2,5000M (+- 170 GB) words corpus from Wikipedia. \n",
    "\n",
    "![bert](https://www.advisa.fr/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/google-bert-algorithm.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish a particular NLP task, the pre-trained BERT model is used as a base and refined by adding an additional layer; the model can then be trained on a labeled data set dedicated to the NLP task to be performed. This is the very principle of **transfer learning**. It is important to note that BERT is a very large model with 12 layers, 12 attention heads and 110 million parameters (BERT base).\n",
    "\n",
    "The BERT model is able to do :\n",
    "\n",
    "* translation\n",
    "* text generation\n",
    "* classification\n",
    "* question-answering\n",
    "* syntax analysis (tagging, parsing) \n",
