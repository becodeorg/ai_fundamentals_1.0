    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) has now become an unavoidable tool in many development environments as well as in modern server hosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are very good reasons to this. The good use of it can greatly simplify deployment of multiple servers both for development and production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately it's not the easiest tool to master, far from it. Here is a non-exhaustive list of the skills you would need to fully master Docker:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Very good knowledge of Linux **command line**.\n",
    "* Extensive experience with Linux **processes and servers**.\n",
    "* Experience with **application deployment automation**.\n",
    "* Good knowledge of **Docker itself** but also **with the various tools used around it** (like docker-compose or Kubernetes).\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that knowing everything will probably take you years of learning and multiple big projects to gather sufficient experience. And still you will have to start using Docker right now for your day-to-day development environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this guide's purpose is to teach you what you need to know in order to start using Docker as soon as possible. You won't know *everything* but you should know just enough to use it for some useful purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The big picture about Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "### It's all about containers\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker's purpose is all about running what we call **containers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you know what a virtual machine is? Did you run one on your PC before? OK, a container is *a little bit* like a virtual machine, with some differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual machine will create a whole environment mimicking a real computer and then let a complete operating system inside the virtual machine run *believing* it is running on a real computer. A container will run *only one program* inside a minimal virtual environment. The real operating system is still your normal one. In fact, when running a container, Docker will only mimic a few components of a real computer:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The filesystem\n",
    "* Volumes (HDD)\n",
    "* The network\n",
    "* ... and not much more in fact\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is that containers are *much faster to run* (a container can start in less than a second) and are *much more resource efficient* (they don't consume more memory than the contained program needs) than virtual machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that containers are a specific feature of the **Linux Kernel**. There are efforts to offer similar features on Windows and Mac but it's not super advanced right now compared to what we can do actually on Linux. So when we're speaking about Docker we are mostly speaking about **Linux**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro tip**: Now that you know the difference between a container and a virtual machine never say to a Docker expert that it's running virtual machines. He might spit in your face without warnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Image and container\n",
    "The two first concepts when we talk about Docker are **images** and **containers**\n",
    "\n",
    "What are they?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, **images** and **containers** are like **Classes** and **instances**.\n",
    "You create a **class** that will define the behavior of all the **instances** that you will create based on it. You need only one class but then you can create thousand of instances of this class. It's exactly the same thing with Docker! *(but if you try to run **thousands** of containers, you computer will burn)*\n",
    "\n",
    "With Docker, we will create images that define which Linux distribution will be used, what will be installed on it, the files that are gonna be present,...\n",
    "We define the **initial state** of our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, based on this **image** we will create a **container**. It will start and run a command. This command will be defined in the **Dockerfile** (we will see what is later). \n",
    "\n",
    "Still confused? Let's take a concrete example.\n",
    "\n",
    "You create an **image** which defines that:\n",
    "* Ubuntu is installed\n",
    "* Python is installed\n",
    "* There is a file located at `/app/hello_world.py` that contain a single line: `print(\"hello container!\")`\n",
    "* When a container is created, it will run these two command: \n",
    "   * `cd /app/hello_world.py`\n",
    "   * `python hello_wordl.py`\n",
    "   \n",
    "Ok cool! Now let's run a container! We will create a container based on our image. This container will start with everything installed and all the files it needs. The first thing it will do is run our two commands. So it will print `Hello container`.\n",
    "We could run multiple containers that do the exact same thing!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why would you do that?\n",
    "I know, you ask me, why would I use such a complicated tool just to print \"hello container\" multiple times. That's so stupid!\n",
    "\n",
    "And you will be right! But it's not the only purpose of this tool. Let me walk you through.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compatibility\n",
    "Ok, let's imagine that you want to create 3 APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* API 1 will need python 3.6.7 and run only on ubntu 18.0.2.\n",
    "* API 2 will need python 3.8 and only run on ubuntu 16.2.0.\n",
    "* API 3 will need Ruby and only run on Arch Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First, having all those python versions will be a pain to maintain and to use. But also, you will need to run different OSes on your computer! \n",
    "Docker can handle that, you can create 3 images based on the OS you need and install the python version you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok but then maybe the problem comes from your code!\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, ok maybe we could re-write the code to make it more standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deployment\n",
    "Now imagine, you have your API with standardized code. Everything works well but you have to deploy it on 30 different servers. You can go to each one, see what's installed or not on each, copy your files somewhere, starting your API manually,... Taking into account that multiple systems run on them. Maybe a Windows one, an Ubuntu and a Debian one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of that, you can just make sure that Docker is installed on each machine (most servers have it).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Restriction\n",
    "Another use case is when you don't have access to the server with `ssh`. \n",
    "A lot of services like Heroku don't allow you to get access to their servers. But you can push a container and they will run it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Other OS\n",
    "The last use case that comes to mind is when you have to work on a different OS than the one that you server will use.\n",
    "If you're using Windows or Mac for example, there are no (or very little) servers running that.\n",
    "You could adapt you code to react differently depending on you OS but honestly it will cause you tons of issues and testing will require you to push your code and test it, then make changes, re-push it. It will be a mess!\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, Docker runs on those OSes! So you can build your image, create a container based on it and connect to it via `ssh`. It will be like using your linux terminal on your own machine!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Isolation\n",
    "The biggest advantage of Docker is the isolation. How many times does it happen that you have everything working on your machine, but when you deploy it on a server, everything is broken! It's hard to debug on the server and you will have to do double the work. With docker, no surprise! If your container works locally it will work on any machine that has it installed!\n",
    "It has even become a meme for developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "![it works on my machine](./assets/work-on-my-machine.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### It's about time!\n",
    "At the end, if you work alone you don't need docker. \n",
    "But if you use it, it will make you gain a ton of time and avoid you so many problems!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "No more excuses now!\n",
    "\n",
