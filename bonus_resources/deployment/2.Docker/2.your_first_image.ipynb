    "* What is a Dockerfile and how to use it?\n",

    "## Installation\n",
    "First things first, we need to install Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "You just have to follow [Docker's well made documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're running Windows or Mac -> https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Docker will need to use `sudo` each time. Let's change that:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to log-out before it applies the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do we create an image\n",
    "In order to create images (or import them), we could:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Go to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) \n",
    "\n",
    "which is like GitHub for Docker images. \n",
    "You need an image with a SQL DB in it? [There is one](https://hub.docker.com/r/mysalt/mysql). \n",
    "You need an image with python 3.6? [There is one](https://hub.docker.com/r/silverlogic/python3.6).\n",
    "And a lot of other images!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create your own docker file!\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, we will want to create our own images, with our own files and our own script.\n",
    "In order to do that we will create what we call a `Dockerfile`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is just a file that is named `Dockerfile` and that contains a script that Docker can understand.\n",
    "Based on that, it will create an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's create our image\n",
    "It's time! So we will create a `Dockerfile` and we will use a python image as base. It means that we start from an existing image to build our own.\n",
    "So we don't have to start from scratch each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this file we will add a line to tell Docker that we want to start from the official Python 3.7 image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `FROM` keyword is used to tell Docker which base image we will use.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Dockerfile\n",
    "FROM python:3.7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's add another line to copy a file. In the folder you're in, there is a file named `hello_world.py`. This file contains a single line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello world!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create folder called `app` and put our file in it. As the python image is built on top of Ubuntu, we can use all the commands that work in Ubuntu.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see some useful keywords that can be used in a Dockerfile:\n",
    "* The `RUN` keyword can be uses to run a command on the system.\n",
    "* The `COPY` keyword can be used to copy a file.\n",
    "* The `WORKDIR` keyword can be used to define the path where all the commands will be run starting after it.\n",
    "* The `CMD` keyword can be used to define the command that the container will run when it will be launched.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```Dockerfile\n",
    "RUN mkdir /app\n",
    "RUN mkdir /app/code\n",
    "COPY code/hello_world.py /app/code/hello_world.py\n",
    "WORKDIR /app\n",
    "CMD [\"python\", \"code/hello_world.py\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's build our image!\n",
    "Now we're ready to create our first image! Exciting right? \n",
    "\n",
    "We say that we `build` our image. That's the term. \n",
    "\n",
    "The command is: `docker build . -t hello`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `docker` to specify that we use docker\n",
    "* `build` to specify that we want to create an image\n",
    "* `.` to specify that the Dockerfile is in the current directory\n",
    "* `-t hello` to add a name to our image. If we don't do that we will need to use the ID that docker defines for us and it's not easy to remember.\n",
    "\n",
    "I already created the Dockerfile for you. Have a look on it!"
