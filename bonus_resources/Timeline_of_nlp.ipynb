    "\n",
    "There are two main dates during this period.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In 1950 **[IBM created the first model capable of translating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown%E2%80%93IBM_experiment)** 60 sentences from Russian into English. This was the first approach to machine translation. Unfortunately, the algorithm was only able to translate these 60 sentences! As soon as an unknown sentence was presented to the model, it was no longer able to translate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Eliza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA)** is a computer program written by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966, which simulates a psychotherapist by reformulating most of the \"patient's\" assertions into questions and asking them. Although Eliza is considered the first chatbot, this model had no level of comprehension, it really just rephrased the questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this period, a rules-based symbolic approach was used. Rules-Based uses Linguistic rules and patterns. *E.g English has the structure of SVO (Subject Verb Object), Hindi has SOV (Subject Object Verb)*.  This has been made possible by regular expressions and [context-free grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar).\n",

    "Natural language processing is, today, essentially dominated by sequence-to-sequence (or seq2seq) models. A seq2seq model is a model that takes a sequence (a sequence of elements of the same type) as input and returns a sequence as output. The example par excellence for this type of model is the translation of text. Among the seq2seq models that have emerged in the last few years, if there is one that stands out, it is the Transformer. The Transformer is a sequence-to-sequence model based on the attention mechanism and not on a recurrent neural network as it was the case for the previous models. On the other hand, we will keep the sequences as inputs and outputs. \n",

    "The Attention mechanism is a measure of how well two elements in two sequences are related. In a sequence-to-sequence context in NLP, the self-attention mechanism is used to determine which word or sequence of words in the entire sequence gives context elements when processing a word. It thus makes it possible to capture the relationships between words, even if they are far apart from each other in the sequence.\n",

This step is repeated several times simultaneously for all the words, thus parallelizing the process. The final vector representation thus generated by the encoder then serves as input to a second network, the decoder, which is used to generate words sequentially.\n",
