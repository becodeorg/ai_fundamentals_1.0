    "A stop word is a word that has very little meaning by itself, such as `the`,`a`, `and`, `an`,...\n",

    "## How to remove these stop words?\n",
    "\n",
    "You could remove them by hand with the `replace()` function, but if you want to go faster, you can use libraries like `SpaCy`, `NLTK`,  `Gensim`, and more. Each library will behave slightly differently, but not enough to make big changes to your model.\n",

    "So as you can see, depending on what kind of information you want to extract, you will be able to exclude stop words. For document classification or semantic search, you will not need those stop words for example.\n",

    "## Customize your stop words\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also add or remove stop words from the list that the libraries uses for stop words. If there is a specific word in your document that should not be considered as a stop word, or one that should absolutely be given to the model, you can do so.\n",
