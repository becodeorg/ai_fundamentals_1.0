# # Drill loops and iterations

# ### 1. Display all students in the "students" list in alphabetical order

# In[8]:


students =  ["Merouane", "Baptiste", "Caroline", "Joe", "Sophie", "Nathan", "Raphaël", "Axel", "Mathieu", "Adrien"]


# ### 2. Display only those whose first name begins with the letter M

# In[ ]:





# ### 3. Display integers from 0 to 15 not included, using a "for"loop and the range() instruction.

# In[ ]:





# ### 4. Use the "break" instruction to interrupt a "for" loop to display integers from 1 to 10 included, when the loop variable is 5

# In[ ]:





# ### 5. Use the "continue" instruction to modify  a "for" loop to display intergers from 1 to 10 included,  when the loop variable is 5

# In[ ]:





# ### 6. Follow the instructions :

# - sort and display the list;
# - add item 12 to the list and display the list;
# - reverse and display the list;
# - display the index of element 17;
# - remove item 38 and display the list;
# - display the sub-list of the 2nd to 3rd element;
# - display the sub-list from the beginning to the 2nd element;
# - display the sub-list of the 3rd element at the end of the list;
# - display the complete sub-list of the list;
# - display the last element using a negative indication.

# In[ ]:


listOfnum = [17, 38, 10, 25, 72]


# Note that some list methods do not return anything.

# ### 7. Write an algorithm that asks the user to enter a number. Then make sure that your program displays all the numbers up to 0, for example, if the user enters the number 3, then your program will display something like this: 3,2,1,0

# In[ ]:





# ### 8.The price is right ! Create a variable that will contain the number to be found. Then create an algorithm that will ask the user to find this price. If the user enters a number that is too high, he will have the sentence: "It's less". If he enters a number that is too low, he will have the sentence: "It's more". If the user finds the right price he will have the sentence: "Well done, you won".

# ### 9. Display all students with the sentence "NAME is a alumni. "

# In[11]:


allStudents =  [["David", "Justine", "Valentin","Axel", "Redouane"], ["Julie", "Stéphane", "Mostapha", "Claudiu", "Son"]]


# ### 10. Display all elements. If the element is part of the first table display - "*PHP* is a backend language" - and if the element is part of the second language, display - "*HTML* is a Frontend language" ... 

# In[ ]:


languages = [["PHP", "Java", "C#"], ["HTML", "CSS", "Javascript"]]
