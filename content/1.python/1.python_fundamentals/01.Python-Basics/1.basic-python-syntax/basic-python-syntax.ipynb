    "Python was designed to be a highly readable language. It has a relatively uncluttered visual layout and uses English keywords frequently where other languages use punctuation. Python aims to be simple and consistent in the design of its syntax, encapsulated in the mantra \"There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it\", from *\"The Zen of Python\"*\n",

    "Python uses whitespace to delimit control flow blocks (following the off-side rule). Python borrows this feature from its predecessor ABC: instead of punctuation or keywords, it uses indentation to indicate the run of a block.\n",
    "\n",
    "In so-called \"free-format\" languages — that use the block structure derived from ALGOL — blocks of code are set off with braces ({ }) or keywords. In most coding conventions for these languages, programmers conventionally indent the code within a block, to visually set it apart from the surrounding code (prettyprinting). "
