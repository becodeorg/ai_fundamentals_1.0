    "## What is Part of Speech?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\"Chunking is a process of extracting phrases from unstructured text. Instead of just simple tokens which may not represent the actual meaning of the text, its advisable to use phrases such as “South Africa” as a single word instead of ‘South’ and ‘Africa’ separate words.\"\n",
