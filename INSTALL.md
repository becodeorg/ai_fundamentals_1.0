# Installation

You are gona dive into the fantastic world of AI, cool! 
But first, we need to prepare our machine to the amazing work we are gona do. 
Don't worry it's not that complicated.

## 1. Install Python
The first step to learn Python is, well, to install it.
To do that, go to [Python's official](https://www.python.org/downloads/) website and download the latest version for your corresponding operating system.

## 2. Jupyter notebook
### What is it?
During this track and the actual course, we are going to use Jupyter notebooks to give you the material.
Jupyter notebook is a Python tool to create or read documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.

These notebooks contain:
* Some text. *(our instructions and explanations)*
* Some code. *(your or our examples)*

You will be able to **execute** your code (or our's) directly in it.

### How to install it?
You need to use a tool that is every developer's best friend: the **terminal**. you know, this black and white, or green thing that hackers use in movies? This is it.
The terminal can seems a bit daunting at first, like black magic . No worries, we're going to do it step by step.

1. Launch your terminal : 

    * On **Windows**, go to your start menu's search and type `cmd`.
    * On **Mac**, open your launchpad *(the place where you can see all your applications installed)*, then search for `terminal`.
    * On **Linux**, search for `terminal` in your applications.

2. Now that you have installed Python, `pip` should be installed too. Pip is the package manager of Python. It will help install extensions and libraries, such as jupyter notebook. The first step will be to determine if pip is installed. In the terminal,type:

    * `pip3 help`
    * **If you get an error message** saying that it can't find a command named `pip3`, try `pip help`. 
    * Still the same error message? Reinstall Python, something went wrong.

3. Now we can install Jupyter notebooks. If `pip3` works, use this one. If not use `pip`. The command to install Jupyter notebook using `pip` is:
    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```
4. To run Jupyter notebooks, you can run:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
5. If it launches a new tab in your internet browser, it worked. If you get an error, something went wrong, you will have to troubleshoot it!

## 3. Let's download the material.
* Click on the green 'Code' button on [this page](https://github.com/becodeorg/training_preparation_ai) and select 'Download ZIP'.
* Unzip it wherever you want.

## 4. Run the notebooks
Launch Jupyter notebooks again. In the browser you should see folders that correspond to the folders sitting on your computer's hard drive.

You will need to find the files you just unzipped. It depends in which folder you ran the `jupyter notebook` command and where you unzipped the files you downloaded.

When you have them, click on `course` folder, then `1.basic-python-syntax` and finally `basic-python-syntax.ipynb`. That's the first course that you'll learn.

## 5. Let the journey begin!
Read the instructions, you're ready to go!
